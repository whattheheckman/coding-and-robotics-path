### Code by whatttheheckman for Coding and Robotics Pathway


This repo contains code I've written for classes in the Coding and Robotics Pathway. At present, it only contains code from the Princples and Design of Cyber-Physical Systems class, in which we designed, built and coded VEX Tower Takeover robots, using Python and C++.

* Manta-Maria: Autonomous code for the drift track
* Block Tickler: Code for a Tower Takeover robot
* Matthew_r:  Code for a friend's Tower Takeover robot
* Moray_Towers: Group 3 Two Minute Autonomous Orange Cubes
* Multithreading: Research of multithreading in VEX robotics
* Port_Mackrel: Group 3 Competition Code
